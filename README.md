# How to use

Run npm i to install dependencies

Run npm start to start the localhost

If browser doesn't open automatically, open the browser and go to localhost:8080

## Test

Run npm test to see test results

## Considerations

The file could be tested by adding a file input field, loading the file into that field dynamically and converting to base64 to avoid CORS issues with canvas. But I believe that it was out of the scope of the task, so I've opted by just opening a localhost. If you want to see it working just let me know.
